# rl-inventory-parser
Load your Rocket League inventory from a Bakkesmod created CSV and do stuff with it!

Very early stages so not much to it at the moment. See the `parse_inventory.py` file to see whats all available in the module and the `examples.py` file for some basic usage.

Note: Python 3.6+ required
